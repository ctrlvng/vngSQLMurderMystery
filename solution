A crime has taken place and the detective needs your help. The detective gave you the crime scene report, but you somehow lost it. You vaguely remember that the crime was a ​murder​ that occurred sometime on ​Jan.15, 2018​ and that it took place in ​SQL City​. Start by retrieving the corresponding crime scene report from the police department’s database. 

SELECT *
FROM crime_scene_report
WHERE date = 20180115 AND city = "SQL City" AND type = "murder";

// Description indicates there were two witnesses. Find the two witnesses.

SELECT *
FROM person
WHERE address_street_name = "Northwestern Dr"
ORDER BY address_number desc
LIMIT 1;

SELECT *
FROM person
WHERE address_street_name = "Franklin Ave" AND name LIKE "Annabel%";

// After finding the two witnesses, look up their interview transcripts.

SELECT person.id, person.name, interview.transcript
FROM person
	JOIN interview ON person.id = interview.person_id
WHERE id = 14887 OR id = 16371;

// Look up the gym member using the witnesses' descriptions.

SELECT *
FROM get_fit_now_member
	JOIN person ON get_fit_now_member.person_id = person.id
	JOIN drivers_license ON person.license_id = drivers_license.id
WHERE get_fit_now_member.id LIKE "48Z%" AND get_fit_now_member.membership_status = "gold" AND drivers_license.plate_number LIKE "%H42W%";

// Look up their interview transcript to find who hired them.

SELECT *
FROM interview
WHERE person_id = 67318;

// Use the hitman's description to track down the person who hired him's driver's license (and identity).

SELECT *
FROM drivers_license
WHERE height BETWEEN 65 AND 67 AND gender = "female" AND hair_color = "red" AND car_make = "Tesla" AND car_model = "Model S";

// There are three poential culprits, but when we bring in income, as the hitman said the woman was rich, there are only two left.

SELECT *
FROM drivers_license
	JOIN person ON person.license_id = drivers_license.id
	JOIN income ON person.ssn = income.ssn
WHERE height BETWEEN 65 AND 67 AND gender = "female" AND hair_color = "red" AND car_make = "Tesla" AND car_model = "Model S"
ORDER BY income.annual_income DESC;

// Now look up who has gone to the SQL Symphony Concert thrice in December 2017.

SELECT person_id, event_name, COUNT(event_name)
FROM facebook_event_checkin
WHERE event_name = "SQL Symphony Concert" AND date LIKE "201712%" AND person_id = 99716 OR person_id = 78881
GROUP BY person_id
HAVING COUNT(event_name) = 3;

// Only one result. Look up the name of the concertgoer.

SELECT *
FROM person
WHERE id = 99716;

// Finally, submit the solution.

INSERT INTO solution VALUES (1, 'Miranda Priestly');
   	 SELECT value FROM solution;
